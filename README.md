# BookStore
Develop a .NET Framework or .NET Core MVC application that displays a list of five book titles from a .NET REST API endpoint.  Display the book titles in a formatted HTML table.  The table should support pagination and sorting of all columns.  Using a 3rd party UI framework or component is encouraged.

The attributes of a book title should be:
-	ISBN
-	Jacket Cover Image
-	Title
-	Series
-	Author
-	Price
